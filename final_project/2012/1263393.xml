    <AbstractNarration>The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, along with its partner organizations, propose to implement a 10-week summer research experience focused on Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology (SPACT), for 10 undergraduate students. Counterfeiting is a growing issue in the U.S., posing serious economic, safety and national security concerns and impacting a wide variety of industries (e.g. pharmaceutics, semiconductors). This REU Site will focus on development of transformative anti-counterfeiting technology, including security printing. Security printing is a field which demands development in four key areas including, advanced materials, advanced manufacturing/patterning technologies, detection and encryption technology, and finally, software and database infrastructure to convert marked products to security end products. The key objectives are to: 1) conduct transformative research in the field of SPACT, and 2) provide STEM research exposure and professional development opportunity to a diverse group of undergraduate students, half will come from Tribal Colleges and other institutions with limited STEM research opportunities. A diverse team of faculty mentors from three partner institutions will build a program in SPACT by applying research methods from various fields of science and engineering. The long term goal is to provide a diverse group of STEM researchers with the needed training and skills to pursue graduate studies and advance the developing field of SPACT. The faculty will mentor students and also conduct seminars and workshops to supplement student's existing academic training in various SPACT disciplines. Students will also participate in a highly integrated professional development and technical communications program. This REU Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Engineering Education and Centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been established to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, half will come from Tribal Colleges and other institutions with limited STEM research opportunities, to the STEM research environment and help them develop as professionals. Counterfeiting is a growing issue in the U.S., posing serious economic, safety and national security concerns and impacting a wide variety of industries (e.g. pharmaceutics, semiconductors). The focus of the student research will be on the development of Security Printing and Anti-Counterfeiting Technology. Students will also participate in a highly integrated professional development and technical communications program designed to stimulate professional development and the development of research skills necessary to succeed in the 21st century. This Research Experience for Undergraduates Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Engineering Education and Centers.</AbstractNarration>
