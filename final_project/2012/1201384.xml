    <AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Energy, Power, and Adaptive Systems Program (EPAS) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches. The objective of this research is to enable large efficiency improvements of Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) devices by focusing on the leading cause of efficiency reduction in OPV devices which occurs in the charge transfer process from donor to acceptor molecules. The approach is to insert an electric dipole layer between the semiconductor donor and acceptor layers to minimize the energy loss with tuned the relative energy levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. This project provides a unique device design rule to increase the open circuit voltage of OPV devices potentially to the thermodynamic limit. This device structure can be applied in any existing polymer system to boost the efficiency without compromising other properties such as the current output or device stability. This is a transformational approach because of its potential to transform OPVs from laboratory subject to vital technology. In addition, the proposed research will provide new fundamental insight into the physics of charge photogeneration, charge collection, and the factors determining photovoltage output of OPV devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The project activities will make significant contributions to scientific knowledge, education, outreach, and will benefit society through technology transfer, training the next generation of scientists and engineers, and informing society about the excitement of organic solar energy production. The project will provide graduate students with innovative opportunities such as industry research experience for graduate students. This project will promote teaching, training, and learning by involving undergraduate involved in the inherently interdisciplinary cooperative research activities and recruiting students from minorities and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
