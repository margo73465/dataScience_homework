    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The overarching paradigm of the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Nanoscience and Microsystems Engineering (NSMS REU) site at the University of New Mexico is to bring physical sciences, engineering and computational modeling together to solve important challenges in the areas of health, energy and the environment. With support from the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation, the unique aspect of this REU Site is that undergraduates are immersed in interdisciplinary research teams where the goal is to harness the unique properties of nanoscale materials into micro- and macroscale devices and systems. There are two technical thrusts: (1) Nanoscience of Biosystems: research to transform and engineer nanomaterials into functional biosystems. Novel drug delivery systems will be developed, including silica-based nanocarriers as cancer diagnostics and therapeutics and engineering live bacterial vaccines for pulmonary delivery. Novel polymers that disrupt the structural integrity of cell membranes will be used to create antimicrobial surfaces, and materials that disrupt protein aggregation in cell membranes will ameliorate the first stages of Alzheimer's disease. DNA templates and biomimetic protease surfaces will be developed for molecular assembly. Single nanoparticle imaging on live cells will track how signal transduction occurs from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to environmental factors. (2) Functional Nanomaterials: research on novel nanomaterials for energy applications and the environment. Synthetic platforms will be designed to create hierarchically structured electrocatalyts for fuel cells, and platinum/palladium catalysts will be studied on the nanoscale to optimize automotive exhaust catalyst efficiency. Manipulation of thermal phonons will be used to design novel nanoscale photonic crystals. Synthesis of ordered bulk heterojunctions from a single copolymer will allow for the design of organic photovoltaics of higher efficiency. Nanostructured materials will be used to design nanocoatings for energy and national security applications, and ferroelectric polymers will be transformed into energy devices like ultracapacitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experience for Undergraduates in Nanoscience and Microsystems Engineering (NSMS REU) site at the University of New Mexico recruits students from diverse ethnic, educational and cultural backgrounds. Undergraduate students from community colleges, 2 year and 4 year institutions though out the US work on research projects with a faculty advisor and a graduate student mentor for 10 weeks in the summer. The goal of the program is to enhance student interest in careers in science and engineering by instilling students with a sense of excitement about scientific discovery and engineering and its broader impact on health, energy and the environment. The NSMS REU program is based on the premise that to benefit society the unique properties of nanoscale materials must be integrated into useful devices and systems on the micro- and macro-scale. NSMS REU students work on research projects to develop new drug delivery systems, combat diseases, design antimicrobial materials, develop better catalysts for cars and fuel cells, and to synthesize new materials for solar devices and energy applications. Students are guided through the process of developing and executing a research plan. Students learn about the global significance of their research and its impact on society, and transition to independent thinkers as the program proceeds. Field trips to National Laboratories and local industries in New Mexico broaden their perspective on future careers in science and engineering. A weekly seminar program featuring faculty and industry speakers provides the context of how their academic curriculum fits into research projects that aim to solve many pressing societal and environmental issues.</AbstractNarration>
