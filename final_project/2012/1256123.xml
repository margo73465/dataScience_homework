    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of Epoxidized Norbornylized Linseed Oil (ENLO) resin as a matrix for reinforced composites. This ENLO resin is a high bio-content, low hazard system with roughly three times the bio-content of any commercially proven resin. In Phase I feasibility was demonstrated and benefits of the system were explored. Phase II funding will be used to scale and refine the resin manufacture process and to develop and demonstrate performance of Bulk Molding Compound (BMC) and Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) utilizing the ENLO resin matrix. The research objectives are to scale the resin process to 1000-gallon reactor size, to identify a cost effective initiation system, to formulate compounds for improved fiber wetout, to characterize and benchmark performance relative to competitive molding compounds, to develop compounds and component prototypes for specific applications, and to explore enhancements to the technology that would provide a wider range of potential market segments. The anticipated technical results are the realization of cost competitive molding compounds based on the ENLO resin, the demonstration of performance in targeted initial application components, and the realization of an ENLO resin chemistry and process for the coatings market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact / commercial potential of this project will derive from the regulatory and green benefits that customers desire to meet strengthened Environment Health and Safety (EHS) demands. The ENLO resin is derived from rapidly renewable raw material streams that can be domestically controlled, liberating the U.S. from the dependence on depleting oil reserves from unstable regions of the world and providing U.S. jobs for our farmers, plant oil processors, and resin manufacturers. Commercial composites resins include unsaturated polyesters, which contain styrene, epoxies made from Bis-phenol A, and urethanes with isocyanate. The ENLO resin contains none of these chemicals of significant EHS concern resulting in safer processes, workplaces, and products. Another major benefit of the technology is that the molded end products will sequester carbon dioxide for the life of the composite, reducing the life cycle contribution to global warming. These benefits will be magnified well beyond the scope of the $18 billion composites market because the same matrix resin can be used in the much larger $99 billion coatings market.</AbstractNarration>
