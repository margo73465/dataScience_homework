    <AbstractNarration>Changes in species interactions between native and introduced ranges of exotic species are important determinants of invasion success. Despite this, little is known about how predation and competition interact to affect the evolution of traits that increase the impacts of invasive species. Underlying predictions of plant invasiveness is the assumption that individuals tradeoff energy devoted to growth and defense, and that the effects of this tradeoff depend on the biotic environment. The goal of this research is to understand how variation in important species interactions contributes to invasive species success and to predict when certain traits that may influence invasiveness are likely to evolve. The project relies on multiple lines of a rapidly growing model plant that differ in lifetime intensity of competition and predation, will characterize differences in life history strategies among these lines, and will use a field invasion experiment to detect the effects of both historic and current biotic interactions on plant success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exotic species threaten global biodiversity by damaging native ecosystems and the services they provide. This project will increase understanding of the evolution in exotic species and bridges the gap between plant ecology and evolution. The project includes a collaboration with Chinese scientists. One of the investigators has considerable experience mentoring undergraduate students, and particularly those from under-represented groups, and plans to continue these training activities during the proposed project.</AbstractNarration>
