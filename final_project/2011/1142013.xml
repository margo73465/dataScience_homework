    <AbstractNarration>Workflow-based systems have emerged as an alternative to ad-hoc&lt;br/&gt;approaches to data exploration that are widely used in the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community. Workflows can capture computational tasks at various levels&lt;br/&gt;of detail and systematically record the provenance (history) information&lt;br/&gt;necessary for reproducibility, result publication and&lt;br/&gt;sharing. Although the benefits of using scientific workflow systems&lt;br/&gt;are well known, the fact that workflows are hard to create and&lt;br/&gt;maintain has been a major barrier to wider adoption of the technology&lt;br/&gt;in the scientific domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to produce new algorithms and techniques&lt;br/&gt;for exploring and re-using useful knowledge embedded in workflow&lt;br/&gt;specifications and in the provenance of the data they manipulate.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses key limitations in existing workflow&lt;br/&gt;systems. First, it develops a set of usable tools that enable casual&lt;br/&gt;users (who do not necessarily have programming expertise) to perform&lt;br/&gt;exploratory tasks and solve problems through workflows. These include&lt;br/&gt;intuitive user interfaces to manipulate collections of workflow and to&lt;br/&gt;query workflows by example. Second, it builds a scalable provenance&lt;br/&gt;management infrastructure to support the efficient execution of these&lt;br/&gt;operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results of this project advance the state of the art and&lt;br/&gt;build fundamental knowledge in storing, querying, and re-using&lt;br/&gt;provenance of computational tasks. This project has the potential to&lt;br/&gt;impact a variety of applications where the creation and maintenance of&lt;br/&gt;workflows is currently a major bottleneck. This includes large&lt;br/&gt;computational science projects and portals. Furthermore, it makes&lt;br/&gt;workflows and workflow technology more accessible to casual users.&lt;br/&gt;Through our interdisciplinary collaborations, this project will have&lt;br/&gt;immediate impact in helping improve the scientific discovery process.&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the project&lt;br/&gt;will provide mentoring opportunities. The PI is committed to&lt;br/&gt;recruiting minority students. The results of this project will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated as research papers and as freely available tools at the&lt;br/&gt;project website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.utah.edu/~juliana/projects/NSF-IIS-0746500</AbstractNarration>
