    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is to explore new ideas to overcome the heuristic approaches of hybrid simulation research of the past decade. In hybrid simulation, the structure is typically idealized into several substructures, where some of the substructures are modeled analytically and the remaining substructures are physically tested and their measured responses are used in the computational algorithm for the numerical integration. This research aims at establishing the fundamentals of hybrid simulation to allow it to become a reliable method for simulation of structures and structural systems. Recent advances in computational mechanics will be used to create algorithms for hybrid simulation through an integrated approach involving both theory and experiments. In that regard, modified variational principles will be used to change the geometric structure of the governing equations for the purposes of time stepping. The research will be conducted using a verification and validation paradigm in which experiments, conducted in the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) and the Civil and Environmental Engineering Structural laboratories at the University of California, Berkeley, will be used to identify the correct theoretical models and algorithms for hybrid simulation by means of different test structures and a tailored experimental program. This exploratory approach brings together the two fields of hybrid testing and computational mechanics, in a synergistic fashion, aiming at the interdisciplinary advancement of the field. If successful, this work will represent a major conceptual shift from the present hybrid simulation techniques and will establish a thorough basis for hybrid simulations rooted on sound experimentation coupled with theoretical and applied multi-scale mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structural safety of the built environment is critical to all citizens. When faced with the challenges of constructing bridges, buildings, power plants, and other infrastructure to withstand the extreme forces from earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters, engineers need to be able to test new ideas in a safe and reliable manner without having to construct full-scale prototypes. The research aims at providing engineers a robust methodology to reliably test components for new designs without having to build complete structural systems solely for test purposes, leading to safer and more reliable structures for everyone. This award also aims to train a new generation of engineers to be knowledgeable in both the theory and practice of hybrid simulation.</AbstractNarration>
