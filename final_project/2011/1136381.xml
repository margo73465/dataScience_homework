    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the STEM for Education (STEM-E) Scholarship Program at Rutgers University is to recruit, retain, and maintain a community of engineers and physicists who are dedicated to teaching in high-needs school districts. Intellectual Merit is encompassed in an overarching theme of "STEM for Humanity" and the program (1) blends the physics and engineering undergraduate programs with the existing graduate physics and mathematics teacher preparation programs, (2) strengthens the focus on teaching physics and mathematics to students in high-needs districts, (3) includes an e-mentoring network between pre- and in-service teachers, and (4) infuses seminars that illustrate the impact of STEM on society. Fifteen STEM-E scholars are being prepared to graduate ready to teach in high-needs K-12 math and science classrooms with strong pedagogical content knowledge and deep understanding of the importance of STEM professionals. Additionally, the program offers long-term continuing professional development to ensure the success of new teachers. Broader Impacts are achieved in that STEM-E scholars will be the nation's leading educational change agents serving in high-need school districts as highly qualified math and science teachers who integrate engineering into their math and physics courses. A mixed-method evaluation plan includes formative and summative assessment of program goals and components. Results are disseminated through the program's website and presentations at conferences.</AbstractNarration>
